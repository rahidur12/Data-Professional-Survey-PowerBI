🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a powerful Data Professional Survey Dashboard using Power BI for visualization and analysis. The dashboard is designed to give stakeholders a clear, data-driven overview of the Data Science and Analytics community's current trends and key metrics through interactive visualizations.

Key areas covered include:

Average Salary Analysis: Detailed breakdown of average salary based on Job Title (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst).

Workforce Demographics: Distribution of Respondents by Country (e.g., United States, India, Other) and the Average Age of Respondents (e.g., 29.87).

Skill Preferences: Analysis of the Most Preferred Programming Languages (e.g., Python, R).

Satisfaction Metrics: Tracking overall Work-Life Balance Satisfaction (e.g., 5.86 out of 10) and Salary Satisfaction (e.g., 4.27 out of 10).

The dashboard provides critical insights for professionals, employers, and students to understand industry compensation benchmarks and in-demand skills.

🚀 Key Insights & Features
✅ Clean, professional layout: Designed following best practices in Power BI for clarity and user engagement. ✅ Key Metrics Tracked: At-a-glance view of the Number of Survey Respondents (e.g., 630), Average Age, and satisfaction scores. ✅ Salary Breakdown: Bar chart comparing Average Salary by Job Title, clearly showing which roles command the highest compensation (e.g., Data Scientist). ✅ Geographical Distribution: Tree Map illustrating the distribution of Respondents by Country. ✅ Technical Skill Analysis: Bar chart quantifying the Most Preferred Programming Languages, highlighting the dominance of languages like Python. ✅ Gender Pay Gap Visualization: Donut chart showing the Average Salary by Gender to analyze potential disparities. ✅ Interactive drill-down: Users can filter and explore the data based on country or job title to reveal localized insights. ✅ Custom DAX Measures for: Calculating normalized satisfaction scores and country-specific averages.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
